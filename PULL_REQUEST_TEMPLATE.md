**Do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first**

*The design of your solution to the problem should be discussed and agreed in an issue before submitting the PR*

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

<!-- You can skip this if you're fixing a typo or adding documentation -->

**Testing**

Any code changes should have accompanying tests.

**Closing issues**

Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes.
